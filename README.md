### Each Servlet/JSP example comes with compiled Java classes so you can easily deploy the app to Tomcat or Jetty. ###
### The dependencies in chapters 15..24 examples have been deleted to save space. To setup the projects, copy all the jar files in the lib directory (except servlet-api.jar and jsp-api.jar) to each project's WEB-INF/lib directory ###
